<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Secretary of State of North Dakota provides a business search [web app](https://firststop.sos.nd.gov/search/business) that allows users to search for businesses by name. This assignment revolves around scraping a subset of this data, followed by visualizing any connections amongst businesses, agents (both commercial and noncommercial), as well as owners.

#### Tools Used:
* [**Scrapy**](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) to scrape the data;
* [**Graphviz's Atlas Layout**](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/graphviz_layout/plot_atlas.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-graphviz-layout-plot-atlas-py) to visualize connecting nodes;
* **Jupyter** to analyze and create graphs of the data;
* **Python** as the language of choice for the aforementioned steps.

### Notable Insights

 *  There are 108 connections (edges, at least one business name connected to one entity). Of these 108, there are only twelve connections (edges) where three of more nodes exist.
 * **Incorp Services, Inc.**, **C T Corporation System**, and **Corporation Service Company** are affiliated with the greatest number of entities when compared to their peers.

### Built With
* [**Scrapy**](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) to scrape the data
* [**Graphviz's Atlas Layout**](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/graphviz_layout/plot_atlas.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-graphviz-layout-plot-atlas-py) to create and visualize edges & nodes
* [**Jupyter**](https://jupyter.org/) to analyze and create graphs of the data;
* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)

### Built For
 * [Sayari](https://sayari.com/) as part of the interview process.
  
### Important Files (i.e. my code)
 * [Scrapy Code](https://github.com/AmirZahre/Sayari_Entity_Resolution_Interview_Assignment/blob/main/sayari_scraper/sayari_scraper/spiders/main_item_method.py) using **Scrapy Item** to capture the data **(preferred choice)**
 * [Scrapy Code](https://github.com/AmirZahre/Sayari_Entity_Resolution_Interview_Assignment/blob/main/sayari_scraper/sayari_scraper/spiders/main_dict_method.py) using **Python Dict{}** to capture the data
 * [networkx Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/AmirZahre/Sayari_Entity_Resolution_Interview_Assignment/blob/main/graph_generation/Company_Connections.ipynb) showcasing the generation of graphs of data generated by the **Scrapy Item** method.
